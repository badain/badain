### It's-a Me, Rafa!😄✌️

- 👨‍🔬 I'm a *Molecular Sciences Scholar* at **University of São Paulo**
- 👨‍💻 I'm also certified in *Computer Science* and *Digital Design**

I'm passionate about learning (anything!) and helping others. Talk to me about: science, biology, coding and visual design.

#### ☄️ In development:

- 🎨 I’m currently developing a [new website](http://cecm.usp.br/inscricoes) for the *Molecular Sciences Program*
- 📊 I'm developing and maintaining [Observatório COVID-19 BR](https://github.com/covid19br/covid19br.github.io)'s visual identity, [website](https://covid19br.github.io) and web/R integration
- 📦 I'm fine-tuning a Python implementation of an approximation to the 3D Bin Packing Problem (3DBPP)

#### ⚡ In my community:

- 👨‍🏫 I teach AP-level computer science to high school students as a private tutor
- 🏆 I'm a judge for the *Interdisciplinarity* and *Academic Merit* awards at the Brazilian Fair for Sciences and Engineering (FEBRACE)

###### *Technically, I'm certified in *Digital Production* (but it's not a very descriptive title)
