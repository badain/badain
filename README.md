### It's-a Me, Rafa!😄✌️
I'm passionate about learning (anything!) and helping others. Let's share ideias about: science, biology, coding and web design.

- 👨‍🔬 I'm a *Molecular Sciences BSc* graduate from the **University of São Paulo**
- 👨‍💻 I'm also certified in *Computer Science* and *Digital Design**

#### 🧱 Stuff I made:

- 🧫 I published a [python pipeline (AMEBaS)](https://github.com/badain/amebas) to help scientists study cell polarity - based in pollen tube growth and ion dynamics data while. Read and hear me talk about it [here](https://app.jove.com/t/64857/amebas-automatic-midline-extraction-and-background-subtraction-of-ratiometric-fluorescence-time-lapses-of-polarized-single-cells).
- 🎨 The [new website](http://cecm.usp.br/) for the *Molecular Sciences Program*.
- 📊 During the pandemic, I maintained the [Observatório COVID-19 BR](https://github.com/covid19br/covid19br.github.io)'s visual identity, [website](https://covid19br.github.io) and web/R integration.

#### ☄️ Current interests:

- 💬 I'm interested in developing technologies to curb disinformation online and help turn human information consumption habits healthier. I've been collaborating on a research to compare the impact of different messaging approaches on health behaviors.
- 📦 I find the 3D Bin Packing Problem (3DBPP) somewhat interesting and have been working on some implementations of [solutions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037722172030406) proposed in the literature.

#### ⚡ In my community:

- 👨‍🏫 I teach AP-level computer science to high school students as a private tutor
- 💬 I organize live talks with innovative researchers @ the [CMnários Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLELdXM2NE8&list=PLxRhdgU89XT_1Ilg4hhR2auNlptYERY1O&index=2)
- 🏆 I'm a judge for the *Interdisciplinarity* and *Academic Merit* awards at the [Brazilian Fair for Sciences and Engineering (FEBRACE)](https://febrace.org.br/)


###### *Technically, I'm certified in *Digital Production* (but it's not a very descriptive title)
