### It's-a Me, Rafa!😄✌️
I'm passionate about learning (anything!) and helping others. Let's share ideias about: science, biology, coding and web design.

- 👨‍🔬 I'm a *Molecular Sciences Scholar* at **University of São Paulo**
- 👨‍💻 I'm also certified in *Computer Science* and *Digital Design**


#### ☄️ In development:

- 🎨 I’m currently maintaining the [new website](http://cecm.usp.br/) for the *Molecular Sciences Program*
- 📊 I'm developing and maintaining [Observatório COVID-19 BR](https://github.com/covid19br/covid19br.github.io)'s visual identity, [website](https://covid19br.github.io) and web/R integration
- 🌱 I'm learning scientific research topics on *Computer Vision* @ the [Computer Vision Research Group (IME/USP)](http://www.vision.ime.usp.br/)

#### ⚡ In my community:

- 👨‍🏫 I teach AP-level computer science to high school students as a private tutor
- 💬 I organize live talks with innovative researchers @ the [CMnários Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLELdXM2NE8&list=PLxRhdgU89XT_1Ilg4hhR2auNlptYERY1O&index=2)
- 🏆 I'm a judge for the *Interdisciplinarity* and *Academic Merit* awards at the [Brazilian Fair for Sciences and Engineering (FEBRACE)] (https://febrace.org.br/)

#### 🔮 In the future:
- 📦 I'll finish my Python implementation of [this approximation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054808002670) to the 3D Bin Packing Problem (3DBPP)


###### *Technically, I'm certified in *Digital Production* (but it's not a very descriptive title)
